  <h1>About Charmers</h1>
  <p>
    Charmers started out as a small local project called <strong>Charming Bracelets</strong>. It was founded by Grace and was only available at a single location in Franklin, Tennessee — 1715 Columbia Avenue, known as MSF. At that time, customers could only buy bracelets in person.
  </p>
  <p>
    Jameson joined the team as the marketing manager and helped grow the business's visibility. In January 2025, the name was changed to <strong>Charmers</strong>, and the business expanded online. They launched a website, a social media presence, and created the first official policy — written by Grace.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, a month later, Grace broke the policy and was removed from the business. Jameson officially became the CEO. Charmers was officially founded on <strong>January 29, 2025</strong>, with its pre-founding date marked as <strong>December 12, 2024</strong>. The first bracelet ever made was created by Grace on <strong>January 12, 2025</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since then, Charmers has become a real online business, offering custom handmade bracelets with fast shipping, VIP service, and support for customers across the United States and internationally.
